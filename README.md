# Micro2_AlarmClock
With a micro processor we made an alarm clock using an LCD screen and other peripherals.

This project used a pic16 and used some files provided by the professor. Any files that were altered or made my own I put the Author as myself. 

This project did work flawlessly but there are no instructions on how to wire this project. I still do have it set up but soon will have to dismantle the project.
